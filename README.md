# üöÄ Chaotic Encryption

This repository contains the code for encrypting an image using the Logistics Map method written completely in Python




## Encryption methods used ‚ö°Ô∏è

#### 1.Only substitution (Confusion method)
Here, the code substitutes every pixel of the image with another pixel (which is obtained by XORing the initial pixel's value with a pseudo-random number (different for every pixel) generated using one of the above mentioned PRNG) thus making the encryption very secure.
